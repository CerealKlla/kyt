/**
 * Builds the "Kyngdoms, A History" written book -- the sole contents of the mod-managed "Welcome"
 * Kyt (see {@code system.SystemKyts}), granted exactly once on a player's true first login (see
 * {@code WelcomeListener}). Rebuilt fresh every boot (via {@code SystemKyts#bootstrap}) so it
 * always reflects whichever mods are actually loaded right now -- each mod's section only appears
 * if {@code ModList.get().isLoaded(modId)} is true, in a fixed order, with Kyt's own section always
 * last (the book itself proves Kyt is loaded).
 *
 * <p>Built against this exact Minecraft version's real decompiled {@code WrittenBookContent}
 * signature (confirmed, not guessed) -- {@code pages} is {@code List<Filterable<Component>>}, not
 * {@code List<Filterable<String>>} (that shape belongs to the different, player-editable {@code
 * WritableBookContent}). No per-page length enforcement is needed at the engine level ({@code
 * PAGE_LENGTH} is 32767) -- {@link #PAGE_CHAR_BUDGET} is purely for in-game readability, since
 * vanilla's own book UI already word-wraps within a page.
